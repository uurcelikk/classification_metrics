# Classification Metrics

This repository contains Python scripts for calculating common classification metrics. These metrics are useful for evaluating the performance of machine learning models, especially in classification tasks.

## Metrics Included

1. **F1, Recall, Precision Calculation**
   - File: `F1_recall_precision.py`
   - This script calculates F1 score, recall, and precision for a given set of predictions and ground truth labels.

2. **Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient Calculation**
   - File: `iou_dice.py`
   - This script computes Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient for segmentation tasks.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have additional classification metrics or improvements to existing scripts, feel free to open a pull request.
